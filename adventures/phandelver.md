# Goblin Ambush & Trail
## Goblin Ambush
> You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.

On inspection:

> The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.

Four **goblins** appear, two on each side of the road. Encounter begins when someone approaches.

**FIGHT!**

Party can spare a goblin, which can be persuaded to lead to Cragmaw Hideout while avoiding traps.

Any inspection will show this has been used for ambushes for a while. A trail behind thickets to north leads northwest to **Goblin Trail**.
